# What is it?

It is a simple task done as part of applying for the position of a Fullstack developer intern.

While writing the code, I tried to take care of the aesthetic appearance following good practices and SOLID principles. The task itself is not complicated, but the appearance of the code was the main focus here.

Computational complexity when searching the array is 0(n) (the simplest method - searching the array index by index).

# What the code is all about?

The code is to find an "outlier" from an array full of even integers (then we find an odd number) or from an array of odd integers (then we find an even number).

# How it the input to that code?

Enter an array to the find_number() method (at least a 3-element array - as it was in the task).

# What could be done better?

Maybe the code should be written in Java, in which it would be worth using multithreading, which would speed up searching the table. This would be a nice added value to the code when running on larger datasets.
