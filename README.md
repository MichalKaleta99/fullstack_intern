# What is it?

It is a simple task done as part of applying for the position of a Fullstack developer intern

# What the code is all about?

The code is to find an "outlier" from an array full of even integers (then we find an odd number) or from an array of odd integers (then we find an even number).

# How it the input to that code?

Enter an array to the find_number() method (at least a 3-element array - as it was in the task).
